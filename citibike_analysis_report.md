##Citi Bike Analysis Report

Citi Bike is a puiblic bicycle sharing system that provides residents and visitors of New York, Jersey, and Hoboken an affordable means of transportation throughout the city. The Citi Bike Data Analysis dashboard story serves to explore over 15 million recent New York Citi Bike data ride records from the past six months, spanning from October 2023 to March 2024. The dashboards will delve into frequency of rides, member and casual use of the Citi Bike system, ride statistics of rides between the most popular stations in New York, and city maps of the top 100 ride stations to start and end Citi Bike rides.

After cleaning, removing of null values, and tapering data for placement into Tableau worksheets, the total number of rides for the six month period is 14,840,192 rides. At first glance of the number of rides by month, it can be seen that number of rides peaks in the month of October with 3.5 million ride, and is at its lowest in January with 1.8 million rides. Rides trend downward in number from month to month until January, where rides then begin to trend back upward to the most recent recorded month of March with a total of 2.5 million rides. It can be extrapolated from this that ridership likely decreases approaching the winter months due to colder temperatures in New York making outdoor riding less favorable. This is supported by the steady increase in rides from January (the middle of winter) onward into the start of spring time in March which usually comes with warmer temperatures. Taking a more detailed look into every day and week of each recorded month, we can see how ride totals further breakdown, particularily between weekdays to weekends. Throughout most recorded months, ridership appears to remain consistently higher on weekedays compared to weekends with only a few Saturdays surpassing the preceding week in total rides, including October 28th, December 2nd, December 9th, and January 27th. A single Sunday on March 3rd surpasses the preceding week in total rides. This trend towards a higher number of rides on weekdays can likely be attributed to the distribution of membership riders against casual riders and their priorities and needs targeted when choosing to use the CitiBike system. Paid membership riders are likely more apt to use the system for more consistent riding purposes such as commuting to work which often occurs during the weekdays for most people. While more casual riders on the other hand will likely only ride as needed or for recreation which would logically occur less frequently than that of a member who consistently rides to and from work daily through the week. This point is further supported by the line graph depicting total rides at each given hour of the day. Little variation is seen in the trend of the line when monthly filters are applied to the graph. The trend however, shows a two peaks of daily rides at both 8:00 A.M. and at 5:00 P.M. which are common hours for workers to leave to their place of employment and to leave work to return home. Outside of these hours, ride totals take a dive downwards across all recorded months.

Under the User Frequency story, the number of rides by members against casual users can be looked at in more detail. Of the total recorded rides, casual riders make up roughly 15% of this number and membership holding riders make up the other 85%. This large discrepancy between members and casual riders is likely due to the fact that New York is a densely populated urban zone making transportation by means of automobile difficult so most residents opt to walk or take a form of public transportation. Therefore it can be speculated that the Citi Bike membership program is very appealing to the native New York resident as a means of efficient transportation through the city, while casual riders may be composed of more visitors who would lose money by investing in a membership plan for a temporary stay. From month to month this trend continues to hold true with casual ridership peaking in October at 19% and hitting a low in January at 11%. Again it can be speculated that due to inclimate weather and cold, casual riders avoid taking bikes whilst member riders who likely must use the bikes to commute will continue to do so regardless of weather, explaining the shift in user type makeup through winter. When looking at member to casual riders at the weekday level, it can also be seen that on average more member rides are occuring monday through friday rather than on the weekends while casual riders typically log more rides on weekends rather than weekdays. When further taking into consideration ride time and ride duration, casual riders on average spend approximately 3-5 more minutes on rides on weekends than on weekdays, with average duration dropping to to a low of 17 minutes on weekends in January, and hitting a high of 23-24 minutes on average in March and October, the warmer months. Members however, remain consistent with average ride durations between weekends and weekdays and averages only go as low as 10 minutes in January and hit a high of 12-13 minutes in the warmer months displaying less variance in ride times than casual riders. Again this is possibly due to membership riders using the bike system to commute daily and keep ride times more consistent while casual riders may be taking a short efficient ride to get from one place to the next or taking a long scenic ride to see the city. 

The popular stations dashboard shows rides occuring between the 15 most active start stations where riders begin rides and the 15 most active end stations where riders choose to end their rides. Interactions between these two sets of stations comprise a total of 57,146 rides, a small fraction compared to the near 15 million total rides occurring within the past six months. This would lead to suggest that although these stations are the most popular stations, they are likely more independent of each other and each serve as hubs for either a starting point to branch out to various possible other stations or a popular destination that multiple less popular start points tend to meet at. Taking a look at the top 100 most active starting and ending stations on the Bike Station Map dashboard it can be seen that a majority of these stations are concentrated in southern Manhattan and on the lower end, these stations have at least a few thousand rides logged while stations on the upper end have 30,000 and up rides. This clustering of popular stations in southern Manhattan may be more likely due to the presence of higher median incomes in the area. From a business perspective, when residents in the area have more disposable income, they are more likely to pay for Citi Bike services as a need for everyday transportation. In the scope of more casual riders, this can also be applicable to the Manhattan area being a popular tourist destination with many locations in the area that visitors will want to see but need efficient means of transport if they are to see them all. The color of the markers also coincides with average ride duration, where lighter and redder markers indicate longer average rides. It can be seen that the darkest red markers occur right next to Central Park where patrons may want to casually ride around and through the park rather than efficiently from one place to the next. This trend likely remains true of any station located in proximity to popular destinations, again making Manhattan an ideal location for more Citi Bike stations as compared to other boroughs of New York.
